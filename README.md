#node-weather  
A really, really basic tool for checking the weather anywhere in the world  

(Inspired by Treehouse's [Node.js Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics) course)  

## Instructions  

First, get an API key from [forecast.io](http://www.forecast.io). Make sure you add it as the value of `API_KEY`.

 Next, run the following command from a bash terminal with Node.js installed:  

    node weather.js "coordinates"  

Replace "coordinates" with any combination of longitude/latitude coordinates. For example: 

    node weather.js "45.5200,- 122.6819"    

returns the weather for Portland, Oregon.  

This thing is super basic, but considering I just started learning Node.js this morning, I'm kinda just rolling with it.
